# Scrobbly <3 you!

Scrobbly is maintained by one person (@leonekmi : me!), i'm very happy to receive contributions from others users.

## The Master Rules

- Please do not refactor or rework code (do it in a dedicated PR if you really want to).
- Please do not PR for multiple sites or functions (do that in seperated PRs).
- Please check if your issue/PR already exists using the search.

## Custom font for icons

The Anilist, Kitsu, MyAnimeList, etc... glyphs are available in `src/pages/al-icons`. This webfont is generated by [Fontello](https://fontello.io). When you zip the folder and import it in fontello.io, you should be able to add assets.

## Snippets

Snippets for websites support are available in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/leonekmi/scrobbly/wiki).
