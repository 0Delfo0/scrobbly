## Update your anime lists

At the same time, **just by watching** on your favourite VoD website, this WebExtension (Firefox & Chromium-based) can update your Kitsu, AniList and MAL lists (for now, it supports only Kitsu, but AniList and MAL are planned for next releases).
**Note : this extension is WIP and might not work at 100%**

### Roadmaps

Here is the roadmap for the first release :
- Kitsu / Anilist support
- Crunchyroll / Netflix support
- UI rework from v1

Second release :
- MAL Support
- Wakanim / ADN / hulu support
- UI improvments
- Get feedback from first release
