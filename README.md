## Update your anime lists

At the same time, **just by watching** on your favourite VoD website, this WebExtension (Firefox & Chromium-based) can update your Kitsu, AniList and MAL lists (for now, it supports only Kitsu and AniList, but MAL is planned for next releases).

## Project state

This branch will host mobile version of Scrobbly, but for now it's a project and it will be low priority. As i said in [this page](https://scrobbly.leonekmi.fr/notsupported.html) :

> Why not, but why ? Many websites supported by Scrobbly have apps for smart devices, which cannot be detected by Scrobbly.
